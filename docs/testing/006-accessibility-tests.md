# Accessibility Testing

The service is designed to meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards.

## Automated testing

Automated accessibility checks are run using Playwright to identify:
- Missing labels
- Colour contrast issues
- Basic ARIA problems

## Manual testing

Manual checks include:
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Focus management
- Screen reader spot checks
- Error messages and hints

Accessibility issues are treated as high priority defects.
