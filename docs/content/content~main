<H3> Progress 8 definition </H3>
This content was approved by Rob Drake, DfE statistician on 16/10/2025

Progress 8 shows how much progress a pupil made compared to other pupils with similar starting points at the end of primary school. The score shows progress compared to the national average:
•	a score of 0 means students made average progress compared to others with similar starting points
•	a positive score of more than 0 means pupils made more progress than average
•	a negative score of less than 0 means students made less progress than average
The confidence interval gives a range of scores the school could have achieved, based on the size of the cohort of pupils and natural variation in pupil performance across England.

<H3> Attainment 8 definition </H3>
This content was approved by Rob Drake, DfE statistician on 16/10/2025

Attainment 8 is used to assess a pupil’s achievement across their best performing 8 subjects.
The 8 subjects that are used in Attainment 8 are split into 3 groups:
•	English and maths, which are both double-weighted
•	EBacc subjects, which include sciences, geography, history, and languages
•	open group which includes any other approved GCSEs or vocational qualifications

Each GCSE grade is given a point score (for example grade 9 = 9 points, grade 8 = 8 points, and so on). The scores from the best 8 subjects (with English and maths counting twice) are added together to give the Attainment 8 score.
If a student scores high grades across these subjects, their Attainment 8 score will be higher. The maximum score a pupil can have is 90.
